# pandas-challenge
Module 4 Challenge
For this challenge, PANDAS will be used to create dataframes using separate csv datasets of School Data and student data for an unnamed school district. The datasets will be merged and summary reports created for the overall district trends for math and reading and individual trends by school.

This homework challenge is missing summaries for "Scores by Type, Size, and Spending" and the overall trend discussion. These sections will be added and this readme file updated, when complete.

The following sources were consulted and used to create these codes:
RU Bootcamp Class Material
GeeksforGeeks.org
